In specific contexts, some Romanian clitic pronouns allow a choice between phonological hosts such as in că-mi dai cartea vs. că îmi dai cartea both meaning [that you give me the book]. What determines the choice between subjunction că in că-mi and prosthetic î in îmi (cf. Lombard 1976)? Popescu (2003, p. 160) argues for speech rate as surface realization trigger (monosyllabic că-mi in fast speech vs. bisyllabic că îmi in normal speech), while Dindelegan (2013, p. 388) argues for register rules (informal că-mi vs. formal că îmi). This means that formal, written language represents one extreme of a formality scale while informal, spoken language the other. Thus, a Romanian corpus of official documents, such as legal texts, is expected to contain only or significantly many forms with prosthetic î for constellations with otherwise optional variants. To test these two hypotheses, the Romanian part of the JRC-Acquis corpus (http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/) has been tagged with the RACAI tagger (http: //www.racai.ro). The resulting corpus of 62,650,821 tokens (including punctuation) has been evaluated wrt. the phenomena under scrutiny. Taking into account specific hosts, enclitic forms have been compared with their î-prosthetic counterparts. The numbers show almost no or statistically insignificant difference in usage for some specific host+clitic pairs (e.g., 3886 să îşi vs. 3852 să-şi [that to himself/ herself ], 200 ce îi vs. 110 ce-i [what to him/her]). From a usage-based perspective, these findings are clear arguments both against the register rules purported by D
indelegan (2013) and against a pure speech rate hypothesis as in Popescu (2003). Since the JRC-Acquis corpus is translated from English by different translators, perhaps both native and non-native speakers of Romanian, a further corpus of original Romanian legal texts is being compiled for further analysis and comparison.</description><description descriptionType="Abstract">The full dataset consists of (1) two tgz-files containing the pos-tagged data extracted from the JRC-Acquis corpus: enclitic forms and  î-prosthetic forms. The data is xml format, which is described in (2) the description file. (3) the draft of the article as pdf-file for linguistic background.</description></descriptions><geoLocations/></resource>
