        <description descriptionType="Abstract">This database was compiled as part of the NWO funded
            doctoral research project entitled “Decolonised Sexualities: The Lived Experiences of
            Black Township Women Who Love Women” under the supervision of Prof. Dr. R.L. Buikema
            (Utrecht University), Prof. Dr. G.D. Wekker (Utrecht University) and Dr. Z. Matebeni
            (University of Cape Town). This research project centres the lived experiences of black
            township women in same-sex relationships in Cape Town and Johannesburg – South Africa.
            The main question—‘How do black township women construct their same-sex
            sexuality?’—called for a mixed methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative
            data which was collected over a 10 month period between January and October 2014. The
            mixed method approach generated 209 questionnaires (physically stored at the Archive of
            the Faculty of Humanities at Janskerkof 13, Utrecht), 34 in-depth interviews, and 18
            focus group discussions from Cape Town and Johannesburg as well as 2 Focus Group
            discussions from the West Coast in the Western Cape. &#xD; &#xD; The mixed methods
            approach I employed was grounded in Utrecht University as well as feminist research
            ethics. In order to produce both the broader picture and the nuanced subtleties of the
            lives and lived experiences of the research participants, the approach included a
            questionnaire that was devised prior to my departure to South Africa. The purpose of the
            survey was not to develop empirical generalisations, but rather to provide an in-depth
            understanding of knowledge, sexual acts and risks of HIV and other sexually transmitted
            infections for black township women in same-sex relationships—the first of its kind to
            be carried out in South African Townships. For qualitative data, a semi-structured
            approach was employed for the focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, for which
            an interview schedule was devised. These various methods were employed to bring out
            subjective meaning, reflection on experiences, and daily lived experiences, as well as
            to gain exploratory insights into the sexuality, kinship, friendships, and intimate
            relationships of the women concerned. For data collection, I collaborated with NGOs -
            The Triangle Project in Cape Town and Forum for Empowerment of Women in
            Johannesburg.&#xD; &#xD; For further description on the methods and data collection,
            please check in the archive folder - Decolonised Sexualities for a word document titled
            "data description". For an in-depth description of the findings from this data set,
